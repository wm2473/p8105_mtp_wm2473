# After import data, I found that the columns name represents the dog types is messy. So I rename all the columns according to their original names. And I found that the weight column containing two units. I separate them into "lbs" and "oz", then combining them into the weights_lbs as total weight. The date column is the number from excel and I convert them into date based on the windows stating date. Finally I dropped NA value from the data set and remove the note column for the next question.

# The left "weightsplot" I use the box plot to show the distribution. We can see the Raisin has the heaviest weights compared to Gagne and Simone. And Gagne and Simone has a similar dog weights. The right "wt" shows the dog's weight over time. The weight of Gagne didn't change too much and keep stable of most of the time. Gagne has a stable weight at the beggining but after Nov 2018, its weight dropped consistenly. And there is no record from Sep 2019, from the notes we can know gagne die in 09/08/2019.Both Raisin and Simone has a weight declined over the three years period. Raisin keep decreasing weight then has a slightly increase but in 12/2020, its weight reach a minimum point. After it, slightly increase again. And Simone is the lightest dog and has a similar trend of Raisin. The weight stabilized at the beginning but start decrease around 07/2020. 03/2021 has a slightly increase then drop to the lowest point at 04/2022.
